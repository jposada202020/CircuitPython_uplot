A small tour for uplot.


Plot Usage
=============
We start importing some fundamental libraries for uplot to operate

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    import displayio
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot

For reference, screen in CircuitPython are defined from left to right and up to bottom. This means
that our (x=0, y=0) will be in the left upper corner of the screen.
For boards or feather with a integrated screen the following statement will initiate the scree

.. code-block:: python

    display = board.DISPLAY

For other displays please consult the right support library

We add the plot area. in this case we are selecting the whole screen as our plot area

.. code-block:: python

    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)

The Uplot will be used to display our graphics. The position and the size of the plot area
could vary. This allows us to have more than 1 plot at the same time in the screen.
Every one of them with different characteristics or graphs.

Options available are:
    * width: width of the plot area
    * height: height of the plot area
    * backround_color: Allows to change the background color. The default is black.
    * box_color: Allows to change the box color. Default is white.
    * padding: allows the user to give the plot area a pad. This is helpful if you are planning to include text and legends in the axes.
    * scale: scale of the plot. This will allow a plot to be scaled up at a user defined rate. This is currently only available for logging and bar plots.


We tell the microcontroller to display our plot:

.. code-block:: python

    display.show(plot)

And that is it you know have a plot area to add amazing graphs!

Good Luck!

Graphics
===========

At the moment the following objects can be added to the plot area:

* Elements in the library
    * Cartesian Plane
    * Ufillbetween graph
    * Stackplot
    * Bar graph
    * Pie Chart
    * Colormap
* Display_shapes library objects
* Histograms from the uhistogram library
* Boxplots from the uboxplot library
* Individual Vectorio Objects

In a more advanced method it is possible to add directly to the plot area using the plot bitmap object

The following code shows an example adding a shape from the Adafruit_Display_shapes
library

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    from adafruit_display_shapes.polygon import Polygon
    from adafruit_display_shapes.roundrect import RoundRect
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot

    display = board.DISPLAY
    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)
    roundrect = RoundRect(30, 30, 61, 81, 10, fill=0x0, outline=0xFF00FF, stroke=6)
    plot.append(roundrect)
    display.show(plot)



Ticks and Grid
===============
Plot axes are shown by default. To change this behaviour you would need
to use the correct keyword in the `Uplot.axs_params` function:

.. py:function:: Uplot.axs_params(axstype: Literal["box", "cartesian", "line"] = "box")

   :param axstype: Option to display the axes

Options available are:
    * box : draws a box
    * cartesian: draws the left and bottom axes
    * line: draws the bottom axis

The following snippet shows how to create a cartesian plot

.. code-block:: python

    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)
    plot.axs_params(axstype="cartesian")

Tick spacing and numbers are selected by default. However it's possible to customize
the following parameters:

.. py:function:: Uplot.tick_params(tickx_height, ticky_height, tickcolor, tickgrid)

   :param int tickx_height: tickx_height in pixels
   :param int ticky_height: ticky_height in pixels
   :param int tickcolor: tickcolor in Hex format
   :param bool tickgrid: displays the tickgrid. Defaults to `False`

.. code-block:: python

    plot.tick_params(tickx_height=12, tickcolor=0xFF0008)


Gridlines are normally ``OFF``. If you want visible gridlines then use:

.. code-block:: python

    plot.tick_params(tickgrid=True)


Colors
===============
You can choose some colors directly from the library. This can be done by importing the color class:

.. code-block:: python

    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import color

This will allow you to use the colors in the list as color variable definitions
    * WHITE
    * BLACK
    * RED
    * GREEN
    * BLUE
    * PURPLE
    * YELLOW
    * ORANGE
    * TEAL
    * GRAY

.. code-block:: python

    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height, background_color=color.WHITE, box_color=color.BLACK)



===========
Cartesian
===========
With the cartesian class it's possible to add (x,y) plots. You can add different (x,y) plots to the
same plot area. After you create your plot area you will need to define the xy plane
for the plot. Secondly, you will need to give some ``x`` and ``y`` data.
This data will be converted to a `ulab.numpy.ndarray`. For more information please refer
to the `ulab` library

.. code-block:: python

    from ulab import numpy as np
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot
    from circuitpython_uplot.ucartesian import ucartesian
    display = board.DISPLAY
    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)

    x = np.linspace(-4, 4, num=25)
    constant = 1.0 / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)
    y = constant * np.exp((-(x**2)) / 2.0)

After the initial setup we add our xy plane and show our plot

.. code-block:: python

    ucartesian(plot, x, y)
    display.show(plot)


There are some parameters that you can customize:
    * rangex and rangey: you could specify the ranges of your graph. Allowing you to move your graph according to your needs. This parameters only accept lists
    * line color: you could specify the color in HEX
    * fill: if you selected this as `True` the area under your graph will be filled
    * nudge: this parameter allows yuo to move a little bit the graph. This is useful when the data start/end in the limits of your range

With the following code, we are setting up the x axis to [-5, 5]
the y axis to [0, 1], line color to Green :const:`0x00FF00` and no filling


.. code-block:: python

    x = np.linspace(-3, 3, num=50)
    constant = 2.0 / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)
    y = constant * np.exp((-(x**2)) / 2.0)
    ucartesian(plot, x, y, rangex=[-5, 5], rangey=[0, 1], line_color=0x00FF00)


if you want to add more than un line to your plot, you could do something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)
    x = np.linspace(-4, 4, num=25)
    y1 = x**2 / 2
    y2 = 2 + x**2 + 3 * x
    ucartesian(plot, x, y1)
    ucartesian(plot, x, y1)
    display.show(plot)


===============
Pie Chart
===============

You can easily create Pie charts with uplot. Pie Charts are limited to 6 elements as per the automatic coloring.
To make the Pie Chart the data needs to be in a python list form. The library will take care of the rest

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot
    from circuitpython_uplot.upie import upie

    display = board.DISPLAY
    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)
    a = [5, 2, 7, 3]
    upie(plot, a)
    display.show(plot)

There are no other special parameters to customize

===============
Scatter
===============
Creates a scatter plot with x,y data. You can customize the circle diameter if you give the radius as a list of values for (x,y) data

.. code-block:: python


    from random import choice
    import board
    from ulab import numpy as np
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot
    from circuitpython_uplot.uscatter import uscatter

    display = board.DISPLAY
    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)

    a = np.linspace(1, 100)
    b = [choice(a) for _ in a]
    uscatter(plot, a, b)


There are some parameters that you can customize:
    * rangex and rangey: you can specify the ranges of your graph. This allows you to move your graph according to your needs. This parameters only accept lists
    * radius: circles radius/radii
    * circle_color: you can specify the color in HEX
    * nudge: this parameter allows you to move the graph slighty. This is useful when the data start/end in the limits of your range


.. code-block:: python

    a = np.linspace(1, 200, 150)
    z = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    radi = [choice(z) for _ in a]
    b = [choice(a) for _ in a]
    uscatter(plot, a, b, rangex=[0,210], rangey=[0, 210], radius=radi, circle_color=0xF456F3)

===============
Bar Plot
===============

Allows you to graph bar plots. You just need to give the values of the bar in a python list.
You can choose to create shell or filled bars.

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot
    from circuitpython_uplot.ubar import ubar

    display = board.DISPLAY
    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)


    a = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    b = [3, 5, 1, 7]
    ubar(plot, a, b)


You can select the color or and if the bars are filled

.. code-block:: python

    ubar(plot, a, b, 0xFF1000, True)


You can also select the bar spacing and the xstart position:

.. code-block:: python

    ubar(plot, a, b, 0xFF1000, fill=True, bar_space=30, xstart=70)

For bar filled graphs you can pass a color_palette list. This will allow you to select the color of each bar
This will not work for shell bars sadly.

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot
    from circuitpython_uplot.ubar import ubar

    display = board.DISPLAY
    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)
    ubar(plot, a, b, fill=True, bar_space=30, xstart=70, color_palette=[0xFF1000, 0x00FF00, 0x0000FF, 0x00FFFF])


with the projection argument you can show the bars with projection. This will give them a 3D
appearance

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot
    from circuitpython_uplot.ubar import ubar

    display = board.DISPLAY
    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)


    a = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    b = [3, 5, 1, 7]
    ubar(plot, a, b, color=0xFF1000, fill=True, bar_space=30, xstart=70, projection=True)


For filled unprojected bar you can update their values. This is useful for data logging.
the max_value argument will allow you to set the maximum value of the graph. The plot will scale
according to this max value, and bar plot will update their values accordingly

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot
    from circuitpython_uplot.ubar import ubar

    display = board.DISPLAY
    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)


    a = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    b = [3, 5, 1, 7]
    my_ubar = ubar(plot, a, b, color=0xFF1000, fill=True, color_palette=[0xFF1000, 0x00FF00, 0xFFFF00, 0x123456], max_value=10)


Then you can update the values of the bar plot:

.. code-block:: python

    my_ubar.update_values([1, 2, 3, 4])

===============
Fillbetween
===============
This is a special case of cartesian graph and has all the attributes of that class. However,
it will fill the area between two curves:

.. code-block:: python


    import board
    from ulab import numpy as np
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot
    from circuitpython_uplot.ufillbetween import ufillbetween


    display = board.DISPLAY

    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)

    x = np.linspace(0, 8, num=25)

    y1 = x**2 / 2
    y2 = 2 + x**2 + 3 * x

    ufillbetween(plot, x, y1, y2)

    display.show(plot)

===============
Color Map
===============

Allows you to graph color maps. You just need to give the values in a ulab.numpy.array.
You can choose the initial and final colors for the color map.

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    from ulab import numpy as np
    from circuitpython_uplot.uplot import Uplot
    from circuitpython_uplot.umap import umap


    display = board.DISPLAY

    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height, show_box=False)

    x = np.array(
        [
            [1, 3, 9, 25],
            [12, 8, 4, 2],
            [18, 3, 7, 5],
            [2, 10, 9, 22],
            [8, 8, 14, 12],
            [3, 13, 17, 15],
        ],
        dtype=np.int16,
    )

    umap(plot, x, 0xFF0000, 0x0000FF)

    display.show(plot)


===============
Logging
===============

This is a similar to Cartesian but designed to allow the user to use it as a data logger.
The user needs to manually set up the range and tick values in order for this graph to work properly

There are some parameters that you can customize:
    * rangex and rangey: you need specify the ranges of your graph. This allows you to move your graph according to your needs. This parameters only accept lists
    * ticksx and ticksy: Specific ticks for the X and Y axes
    * line_color: you can specify the color in HEX
    * tick_pos: Allows to show the ticks below the axes.
    * fill: generates lines under each point, to fill the area under the points


.. code-block:: python

    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)

    ulogging(plot, x, y, rangex=[0, 200], rangey=[0, 100], ticksx=[10, 50, 80, 100], ticksy=[15, 30, 45, 60],)

===============
SVG
===============

A small module to load, locate and scale svg path collection of points in the plot area. This will tend to be memory consuming as some SVG will have several path points.
There are some pre-provided icons in the ``icons.py`` file, you could add more if needed.
Specific icons are stored as a dictionary in the icons.py file. Every path is a entry in the dictionary.
For example, if you want to load the Temperature icon with a scale of 2

.. code-block:: python

    from circuitpython_uplot.usvg import usvg
    from circuitpython_uplot.icons import Temperature

    display = board.DISPLAY
    plot = Uplot(0, 0, display.width, display.height)
    usvg(plot, Temperature, 250, 50, 2)
    display.show(plot)
