Dependencies
=============
This library depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

This library is resource consuming, may or may not with some CircuitPython supported devices.
Tinker it as you wish in order to work.

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.


Installing from PyPI
=====================

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/circuitpython-uplot/>`_.
To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circuitpython-uplot

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install circuitpython-uplot

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install circuitpython-uplot

Installing to a Connected CircuitPython Device with Circup
==========================================================

Make sure that you have ``circup`` installed in your Python environment.
Install it with the following command if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circup

With ``circup`` installed and your CircuitPython device connected use the
following command to install:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup install circuitpython_uplot

Or the following command to update an existing version:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup update
